Dear %RECIPIENT%,

I hope this email finds you well.

In preparation for my college application to %UNIVERSITY%, I am planning to take the Duolingo English Test to fulfill the English proficiency requirement. Due to my low-income financial background, I am exploring the possibility of gaining a fee waiver for this test.

I wanted to inquire if %UNIVERSITY% offers fee waivers for the Duolingo English Test to prospective international students and, if so, whether there is a specific process I need to follow to gain the waiver. Any guidance or further information you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,
%NAME%
